# Introduction

Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

Thanks for taking the time to complete this brief take-home assignment. *Please
timebox your effort to a maximum of 3 hours.*

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your Wordpress skills (Wordpress, styling,
accessibility, responsive, 3rd-party integration, testing, and more). Feel free
to make any assumptions, simplifications, or other changes to the problems -
**though please state those in your write up (README.md) when you submit this
assignment**. Please use as many libraries, plugins, etc as is reasonable, however, please
state your reasoning so we better understand your thought
process.

The objective of this assignment is to build a simple Wordpress page that
displays a property list view. It should use the data returned from the SimplyRETS API
match the following [Figma design
mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/YZyIbis7fMsKnE2KaRlhYc/Sample-Project-Engineering?node-id=0%3A1). SimplyRETS is an API commonly used in real estate and you will need to use it to
retrieve the properties data.

Before getting started, please read this document carefully.

**Good luck ðŸ™ƒ**

# Acceptance criteria

- Using Wordpress, create the following page:
  Property Listings
  - NOTE: This page should be built with the consideration that other pages
    would eventually be added. Not looking for any over-engineering here, simply
    an understanding of how you would structure your application given that bit
    of context.
- Implement the following design:
  - A global sticky header containing the page name
  - Output the data from the SimplyRETS API into a list view of properties. Each
    property should at least display the following information: 
    - `bedrooms`
    - `bathsFull` + `bathsHalf` (ex: 1 full + 3 half = 2.5)
    - `area` (as Sq Ft)
    - `listPrice`
    - `address`
    - `listDate` (MM/DD/YY)
    - `photo[0]`
    - Favorite state: White outlined heart if not favorited, red heart if
      favorited. *(Heart SVG assets included.)*
  - Use style definitions from Figma when possible
  - Desktop and Mobile screen sizes are provided. All screen widths from 375 to
    1180 should be supported. Intermediate responsive behavior should be
    inferred.
- Get data from the SimplyRETS property endpoint on Property Listings page load
  + cache in local storage
- On the Property Listings page, the visitor can click the heart to save the mlsId
  associated. Store the saved/favorited properties in the browser local storage.
- Add any tests to satisfy confidence in your application. *Be sure to document
  the types of tests you choose and why*
- Styles can be handled in any manner you choose â€“Â i.e. scss *(included in build)*, css, etc...
- This application is expected to be built utilizing current patterns and best
  practices. You may use any combination of the included plugin, theme or both.
- Explain any design decisions (*including items left out due to time
  constraints*) in the README.md file

# What you will be assessed on

- All functional requirements must be satisfied
- The application successfully builds
- The application successfully runs with no console errors or warnings
- Production-like code that must be well coded, clean, and commented 
- UI must be responsive and clean
- UI should closely match the mockup.
- Intermediate screen width behavior should be reasonable. 
- General understanding of semantic markup and accessibility
- Tests must be passing and meaningful
- General Wordpress knowledge

# Submission

Once you are satisfied with your assignment, please publish your code and README
to a Git repository and send the repository link to the email our recruiter has
provided.

# Getting Started

1. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and its prerequisites. 

2. Install and use Node 14

3. Run `yarn build` to install theme and plugin deps.

4. Run `docker-compose up -d` to spin up a Wordpress instance.

5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

6. Go through the Wordpress installation wizard and sign in with your newly created user.

7. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/plugins.php` and activate the Side plugin.

8. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/wp-admin/themes.php` and activate the Side theme.

9. Run `yarn test` to open the the testing dashboard.

Optional: When editing the theme or plugin, `cd` to `/wp-content/themes/side` or `/wp-content/plugins/side` and run `yarn watch` so that your changes are picked up.

## What will you find inside this boilerplate

In this boilerplate, you will find:
- A basic theme located at `/wp-content/themes/side`, which is a child theme of `/wp-content/themes/twentytwentyone`. 
    - `scripts.js` which is the entry point for your JS
    - `style.scss` which is the entry point for your styles
    - `page.php` which is the template for a page
- A basic plugin named `/wp-content/plugins/side`
    - `scripts.js` which is the entry point for your JS
    - `style.scss` which is the entry point for your styles
    - `side.php` which is the entry point for your plugin
- Styles 
- Integration testing with [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/introduction-to-cypress) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/)
    - `cypress/integration/setup.js` which is a basic example test that asserts that the theme and plugin are activated.
- A `README.md` file to document your comments and design decisions

## Design Mockup

For the mockup, use [this Figma
design](https://www.figma.com/file/YZyIbis7fMsKnE2KaRlhYc/Sample-Project-Engineering?node-id=0%3A1).
Both desktop & mobile are included.

The favorite heart icons are already provided as SVGs in the theme and plugin in the `/images/`
directory. The font used in the mockup has also already been provided in the theme in 
`styles.scss`.

## SimplyRETS API

SimplyRETS is a platform for developers and agents to build real estate
applications and websites.

Their API uses Basic Authentication, which most HTTP libraries will handle for
you. To use the test data, you can use the api key `simplyrets` and secret
`simplyrets`. Note that these test listings are not live RETS listings but the
data, query parameters, and response bodies will all work the same.

Please use the following endpoint: https://api.simplyrets.com/properties. More
information can found in the [SimplyRETS
documentation](https://docs.simplyrets.com/api/index.html#/Listings/get_properties).
